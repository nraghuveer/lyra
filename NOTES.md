1. Undo must be localized
    A action should be undo-able only if it is performed by same user

F-Bounded Poly

trait T[U <: T[U]]
Even Java 5 had it -> class Enum[E extends Enum<E>]

recursively type signatures

parameterics polymorphism with subtyping => bounded quantification
f-bounded => if subtype constraint itself is parameterized by one of the binders occuring on the left-hand side

lets us encode contrainsts on generics
simplify and reduce the number of unit tests
