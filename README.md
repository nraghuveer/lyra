Just another Web-based canvas collaborative editor.

This is mainly intended towards learning "Differential Synchronization" paper in the context of editing collaborative canvas.
Used scala.js to make front-end, because In felt scala type-system has so much to offer for the front-end dev.

Another motivation for this project is Apple's FreeForm, which is tightly coupled with its eco-system. 
With Web-ecosystem, we can re-create this for all any device. Planning to use web-rtc to sync changes using above paper.

Let's see how this goes!
